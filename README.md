## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Connor. An Indie Game Developer based in the UK.

I have a big project I'm working on right now, and have been since June 2020.
It's going well, and I have built some things that I plan to make public on here once the Project is complete!

Until then... this README remains barren, sorry!
