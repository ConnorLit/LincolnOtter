## Hi there 👋

I'm LincolnOtter. A Developer based in the UK and I code with GameMaker Language, C#, PowerShell and SQL.

I am very passionate about buidling Video Games.

I have a big Indie Game 🎮 project I'm working on right now, and have been since June 2020.
It's going well, and I have built some things that I plan to make public on here once the Project is complete! 💻

Until then... this README remains barren, sorry! ✌
