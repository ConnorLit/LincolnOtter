## Hi there 👋

I'm Otter. A Developer based in the UK and I code with PowerShell, GML, and C#.

I spend most of my spare time working on person Game Dev projects. I currently have a big Project I've been working for just over a year. 🎮
It's going well, and I have built some things that I plan to make public on here once the Project is complete! 💻

Until then... this README remains barren, sorry! ✌
