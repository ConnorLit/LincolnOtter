## Hi there 👋

I'm Connor. An Indie Game Developer based in the UK. 🎮

I have a big project I'm working on right now, and have been since June 2020.
It's going well, and I have built some things that I plan to make public on here once the Project is complete! 💻

Until then... this README remains barren, sorry! ✌
