## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Connor. A Developer based in the UK.

For work I code with C#, PowerShell and SQL... But I love making video games!

I have a big Indie Game ðŸŽ® project I'm working on right now, and have been since June 2020.
It's going well, and I have built some things that I plan to make public on here once the Project is complete! ðŸ’»

Until then... this README remains barren, sorry! âœŒ
